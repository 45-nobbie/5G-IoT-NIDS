# src/protocols/__init__.py
# This file makes the directory a Python package.
# You can optionally import specific protocol layers here to make them easily accessible.

# Example (once layers are defined):
# from .nas import NASLayer
# from .ngap import NGAPLayer
# from .coap import CoAPLayer
# from .mqtt import MQTTLayer
